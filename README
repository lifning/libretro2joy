libretro2joy : A libretro core that emulates USB gamepads with uinput.

This might be handy for remapping buttons on physical gamepads, or synchronizing
gamepad data over the network using RetroArch's netplay code.

TODO:
 * Analog support
 * Launch a given executable with load_game_special.
   - This will make synchronizing native games easier when using netplay.
